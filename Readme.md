# How to use

This script uses selenium, with the firefox driver. You need to have *geckodriver*.

On Ubuntu (works on Ubuntu 20.04):
```bash
sudo apt install -y firefox-geckodriver;
```

To install node dependencies : `npm install`.

Launch with `npm test`.

With the current version of the website (found at https://github.com/jleveau/M2-Workshops), you will need to restart the node server between each test run.
